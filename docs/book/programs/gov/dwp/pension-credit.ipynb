    "# Pension Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Pension Credit is a means-tested benefit payment administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in the United Kingdom. It was introduced to provide financial assistance to pensioners and ensure they have a minimum income level. Pension Credit combines two main elements: Guarantee Credit and Savings Credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guarantee Credit: Intended for pensioners who have reached the qualifying age and have a low income. It tops up \n",
    "  their weekly income to a guaranteed minimum level, which varies based on individual circumstances.\n",
    "* Savings Credit: Designed for pensioners who have saved for their retirement or have a modest income. It provides \n",
    "  additional support to those who have some savings or a second pension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pension Credit parameters can be found in `policyengine_uk/parameters/gov/dwp/pension_credit` and logic in `policyengine_uk/variables/dwp/pension_credit.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Legislation\n",

    "The legal framework for Savings Credit is primarily defined in the legislation provided on the [State Pension Credit Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/16/section/3) legislation website. \n",
